      <h1>Chapter 2 – After Class</h1>

      <p>
        After class, the campus looks different. The sun is higher now, and the shadows that were
        long and gentle in the morning have shrunk into sharper shapes under the benches and trees.
        King walks slowly, not because he is tired, but because it is easier to move when nobody is
        expecting him to be anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        His friends — if he can still call them that — have their own corners of the school. Some
        of them stay in the library, some claim a spot in the cafeteria, others disappear into
        clubs and organizations that give them a reason to stay late. He, on the other hand, has
        a habit of drifting.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hallway outside the classroom is quieter now. Only a few students linger, talking in
        small circles. Their conversations trail off when he passes, not because he is important,
        but because he is background noise their minds do not register. He leans briefly against
        the wall, pretending to check his phone.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a message from a group chat he muted weeks ago. Memes, complaints about homework,
        someone sharing a blurry photo of their lunch. He stares at it longer than necessary, then
        locks the screen. It is easier to scroll through other people’s lives than to decide what
        to do with his own afternoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, he ends up outside, near the small garden that tries its best to look alive in
        the middle of concrete. A few potted plants lean toward the light, leaves dusty but
        determined. There is a bench here, half hidden by a low wall. He sits there, letting the
        world pass by at its unbothered pace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Somewhere nearby, a group of students are practicing a performance piece. He hears the
        same line repeated, over and over, their voices moving between tired and dramatic. It is
        a confession, or maybe an apology. The words are too distant to catch clearly, but the
        rhythm of them stays.
      </p>
      <p>
        King opens his notebook again. The half-finished sentence from the morning waits for him,
        patient and silent. He could finish it now. He could pretend it was always meant to end
        this way. Instead, he turns the page and starts a new paragraph, writing about the garden,
        the cracked bench, the distant sound of voices trying to be heard.
      </p>
      <p>
        He writes slowly, letting the pen drag a little across the page. The letters are not neat,
        but they are honest. This, at least, is something he can control: where a sentence begins,
        where it pauses, where it decides to stop. Outside of the notebook, his life refuses to
        follow such easy rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the afternoon stretches on, the campus becomes busier again. People move from one room
        to another, bell reminders and phone alarms sending them to the next part of their day.
        King stays on the bench just a little longer, as if sitting still will keep time from
        pushing him forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        This entire chapter is still placeholder text, but that is the point. It gives the page
        enough height so the reader can scroll, enough lines for the reading bubble to count, and
        enough space for future scenes when you decide what truly happens “after class.”
