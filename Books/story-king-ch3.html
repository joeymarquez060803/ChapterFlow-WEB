      <h1>Chapter 3 – Things Left Unsaid</h1>

      <p>
        The day is almost over by the time King notices how quiet the campus has become. The halls
        that felt crowded in the morning now hold only echoes: footsteps fading, a door closing
        somewhere far away, the low thud of a book being dropped into a bag.
      </p>
      <p>
        He finds himself on the top floor, near a window that looks out over the courtyard. From
        here, the buildings look smaller, the people even more so. There is a faint orange tint to
        everything, the kind of warm light that makes even the concrete look softer for a moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        On his phone, an unsent message waits in the drafts. It has no greeting, no name, just a
        single line: <em>Hey, are you still on campus?</em> He stares at it, thumb hovering over
        the send button, then locks the screen again before he can decide.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are things he wants to say. Thank you. I’m tired. I’m still here. I don’t know what
        I’m doing. He cycles through all of them silently, none of them making it past his teeth.
        Words are easy when they are written down; they are much heavier when someone is actually
        listening.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the window, he sees students walking toward the gate in pairs and groups. Some of
        them stop to talk, pointing at the sky, laughing about something he cannot hear. Others
        walk alone, headphones in, eyes fixed on whatever world they have playing just for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        King presses his forehead lightly against the cool glass. The reflection shows a version
        of himself he does not fully recognize — someone who looks like they belong here, someone
        who has plans after this, someone who is not just drifting between rooms and days.
      </p>
      <p>
        He thinks about the notebook in his bag, about the unfinished sentences waiting there.
        Maybe that is all this is: a collection of lines that never quite say everything he means.
        Maybe that is why he keeps writing, even if no one ever reads it; the page is the only
        place where “things left unsaid” can still exist safely.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sky slides slowly from orange to purple. Lights flicker on across the campus, one by
        one, like small promises that the day is not completely over yet. He watches them until
        the window reflects more of the inside than the outside.
      </p>
      <p>
        At some point, he finally moves. He adjusts the strap of his bag, checks his phone one
        more time, and walks away from the window. The message in his drafts stays where it is,
        unsent but not deleted, like a thought he is not ready to let go of.
      </p>
      <p>
        This placeholder chapter is here so the page scrolls, the timer runs, and the reading
        layout feels real. Later on, you can replace every line with the true ending you want for
        King — or keep it exactly like this, a quiet moment made of everything he never says out
        loud.
