      <h1>Chapter 1 – The Quiet Start</h1>

      <p>
        This is placeholder chapter text for testing scroll and layout. Imagine the corridor just
        outside the classroom, still half-asleep from an early lecture, windows breathing in soft
        morning light. Desks scrape, chairs clack, and the small noise of bags zipping shut feels
        louder than it should.
      </p>
      <p>
        King stays seated a little longer than everyone else. Not because he is busy, not because
        he is interested in the lesson, but because he has nowhere particular to rush to. The room
        empties in waves: first the loud ones, then the quiet pairs, then the ones who pretend they
        are not walking out alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        On his notebook, the last thing he wrote is only half a sentence. The ink trails off where
        his focus did. He runs his thumb over the words, smudging a little line of black, as if he
        can erase the thought by accident. Outside the door, the hallway hums with the leftover
        echo of everyone else’s morning.
      </p>
      <p>
        He finally stands, the chair legs scraping just enough to make his existence known for one
        brief second. No one turns around. He slips his notebook into his bag, checks his phone for
        messages that will not come, and steps into the corridor that smells faintly of paper,
        dust, and cheap coffee.
      </p>
      <p>
        The campus is awake, but softly. A few students lean against the railings, scrolling
        through their own worlds. Someone laughs at something on their screen. Another person
        presses a book to their chest like a shield. King walks past them, a quiet shape moving
        through other people’s mornings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Down the stairs, the sunlight becomes sharper. It cuts through the gaps between buildings,
        streaking the floor with long rectangles of brightness that he carefully steps around, as
        if they are lines of chalk he must not cross. There is no reason for this; it is simply
        a habit he made one day and never questioned.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a bench near the courtyard, someone has left a notebook open, its pages fluttering in
        the breeze. He pauses beside it for a moment, watching the paper ripple like a quiet wave.
        The handwriting is small and careful, full of sentences about things he does not know.
      </p>
      <p>
        He thinks, for a second, about closing it. About returning it to whoever left it behind.
        About reading one line and pretending that, just for today, he stepped into someone else’s
        story instead of avoiding his own. But the thought passes. King keeps walking, leaving the
        notebook where it is, as if stories are safer when they are untouched.
      </p>
      <p>
        From here, the day will look ordinary: classes, hallways, a cafeteria line that moves too
        slowly, the sky changing colors while nobody is really watching. But something about this
        morning feels slightly heavier, like the pause between two notes in a song that is about to
        change key.
      </p>
      <p>
        This chapter is only a placeholder, but it is enough for now. The important thing is that
        this page feels like a focused reading view for a single chapter, long enough to scroll,
        long enough for the reading bubble to track time, and separate from the main book overview.
